# ForsenPlace Script

Forsen related script. Forsen bots, automation, cheats, extensions, total r/place domination. Everything that is somewhat related to Forsen. 

## Instructions

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) browser extension.
2. [Click this](https://github.com/ForsenPlace/Script/raw/main/script.user.js). Tampermonkey should let you install the script. Click on **Install**.
3. Restart your browser.
4. Open a [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place) tab. If it's working you will see "Obtaining access token..." at the top right.

## Things to know

- The script automatically fetches new [orders](https://github.com/ForsenPlace/Orders).
- Using multiple accounts at the same time can get you "banned" (you get a very long delay) from r/place.
